### Coding and simple problems
Tuesday's session will be held in the INF252 at 6pm again, where we will go through coding solutions to simple quantum puzzles. Throughout this I will try to explain the physics behind what is happening. 
If you want to be ready for this, simply run ```pip install pennylane``` and be ready to use some jupyter notebooks (although this is not strictly necessary, it will help with not having to type quite as much).
