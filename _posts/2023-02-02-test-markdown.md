### Welcome!
We will be meeting at the Kleiner HÃ¶rsaal (the Seminarraum) @ INF 252 on Tuesdays at 6pm. Drinks will be provided! 
Please RVSP by email (daniel.bultrini@uni-heidelberg.de). 
The first session will be on the 14th of February 2023, where we will do a brief introduction (for all levels) to the field followed by a discussion of where we would like to focus on as a group.
