### Welcome!
We will be meeting at the INF 229 on tuesdays at 6pm. Coffee and tea will be provided! 
Please RVSP and be at the main entrance at 6 sharp, as the doors need a keycard to unlock. 
The first session will be on the 9th of February 2023, where we will do a brief introduction (for all levels) to the field.
