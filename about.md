We are a student lead group that organizes regular workshops and meetings to learn about quantum computing. We also aim to form teams to compete in various hackathons. Of course, our general reason to be is to interact with the subject, discuss ideas and create a space for training and research in this topic at the university.   
We are open to private consulting contracts to research how applicable quantum computing may be to your company or industry at large, as well as knowledge of which companies are investing in researching quantum computing applications in house.
